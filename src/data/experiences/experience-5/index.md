As an instructor, my primary responsibility was to educate students on Java Enterprise Edition, with a particular emphasis on foundational concepts related to Servlets and JSP. I also covered the development of RESTful APIs using plain Java EE and Spring Boot, in addition to imparting knowledge on secure coding practices.
